      <description>My Daughter&amp;rsquo;s book This is part of my Challenge to make 26 years before 2017 ends.
I had an overdue and on-going task in my list: write a book for Erin, my daughter. I began writing a fantastic tale about Erin (our fearless heroin) and her surprising companion back in June 5th 2017, and now, November 25th it is finally done and sent to the printers.
Literally.

In Spanish.</description>

      <description>Erin&amp;rsquo;s children&amp;rsquo;s book This project is quite personal, as it is my first children&amp;rsquo;s story ever to be published solely for my daughter, Erin. It has a lot of inside jokes and references.
It was meant to be her birthday&amp;rsquo;s gift (last May), however due to work and other demons, it had to be postponed and now it will be her Christmas present - I hope I don&amp;rsquo;t screw up this time.</description>
