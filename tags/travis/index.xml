      <description>This blog Creating an improving this blog is itself a project. Although I prefer to keep day to day progress in separate blog posts, I thought it would be good to keep track of the projects&amp;rsquo; evolution in a single placeholder - tags are also helpful and included, but this way I can have a better index for my own later reference.
Some specific about the blog, like minimum improvements like adding tags, categories, or internal links, are not necessarily tracked in a post, as I already made publicly available the blog&amp;rsquo;s sources - peep as you need!</description>
