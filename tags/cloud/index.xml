      <description>Understanding Amazon This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This is a short post - I had in my list for a long time to start using Amazon, however it is a big bone to chew at once, so I decided first to take a small stab and first understand what Amazon is all about.
Udemy Academy has a free video course on AWS concepts, which made easy to follow through in my mobile phone while commuting to work what Amazon is all about: VPCs, EC2, S3 and RDS (lot of acronyms).</description>
