      <description>This blog Creating an improving this blog is itself a project. Although I prefer to keep day to day progress in separate blog posts, I thought it would be good to keep track of the projects&amp;rsquo; evolution in a single placeholder - tags are also helpful and included, but this way I can have a better index for my own later reference.
Some specific about the blog, like minimum improvements like adding tags, categories, or internal links, are not necessarily tracked in a post, as I already made publicly available the blog&amp;rsquo;s sources - peep as you need!</description>

      <description>Deploy a Hugo website to Github pages and build with Travis CI  GitHub provides free and fast static hosting over SSL for personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository via its GitHub Pages service.
 I know there are other options, such as Netlify, but I was not too keen to yet depend on another framework, specially one using node.js&amp;hellip; famous last words&amp;hellip;

      <description>Create a blog using Hugo Hugo is an open source static site generator based on Go
This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends. Proudly to say, this is the begining of my journey.
Quick-start Taken from Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation
Install Hugo and other dependencies Heads-up: you will need Homebrew.
brew install hugo  Check the version:
$ hugo version Hugo Static Site Generator v0.29 darwin/amd64 BuildDate: 2017-09-30T22:45:47+02:00  Seems we are good to go!</description>
