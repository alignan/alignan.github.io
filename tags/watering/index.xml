      <description>IoT automated plant watering and monitoring system This project idea came out while thinking about stuff to build before year 2017 ends. The motivation is simple: avoid plants dying in my watch, likely also saving some lives in my wife&amp;rsquo;s garden as well if everything goes OK.
Whilst installing sensors is easy, I want to experiment with other technologies and paradigms as well, thus this project is a sandbox to learn and test new concepts and applications, having a concrete use case in mind.</description>
