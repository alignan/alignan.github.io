      <description>Monitoring my plant using sensors, relayr&amp;rsquo;s cloud, resin.io and the Raspberry Pi This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This post is a continuation of the Raspberry Pi powered plant monitoring system post, in which I discussed the project requirements, and briefly showed how to flash the resinOS to a Raspberry Pi and waterproof a soil sensor.
Nothing too fancy by then.
Now I will show:</description>

      <description>IoT automated plant watering and monitoring system This project idea came out while thinking about stuff to build before year 2017 ends. The motivation is simple: avoid plants dying in my watch, likely also saving some lives in my wife&amp;rsquo;s garden as well if everything goes OK.
Whilst installing sensors is easy, I want to experiment with other technologies and paradigms as well, thus this project is a sandbox to learn and test new concepts and applications, having a concrete use case in mind.</description>

      <description>Monitoring my new plant using sensors and the Raspberry Pi This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This type of project is nothing new in the Makersphere, using environmental sensors with the Raspberry Pi (and Arduinos, ESP8266, etc.) has been done since it&amp;rsquo;s early beginnings, and it is perhaps one of the most implemented use cases.
Then what is new?
Likely nothing surprisingly, however, I would attempt to take this above the normal &amp;ldquo;demo and forget&amp;rdquo; existing setups, and create something with a product-oriented approach.</description>

      <description>My new bonsai This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
Finally, after some consideration and procrastination, I decided to get a plant (and care for living beings). Fortunately, my current company has a great policy about office plants for employees.
Enter &amp;ldquo;Ligu&amp;rdquo; 
I got the bonsai from Exotenherz, an on-line shop specialized in plants, with an awesome shipping time and great care to transport plants.</description>
