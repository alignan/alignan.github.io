      <description>A review from an Intern 
I take great proud of teaching and developing my team members - both professionally and personally - it is the most rewarding experience and joy of being a technical manager.
Team development is not not only related to the Junior members of the team, but Seniors as well: there are several dimensions which contributes to career development, being the most proficient coder is not enough, if you can&amp;rsquo;t lead others by example or fail to clearly communicate ideas to peers and managers.</description>
