      <description>Our trip to Berlin This is part of my previous Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying to finish now in 2018.
After living and working abroad (in Berlin, Germany) for almost a year, having my family (finally) joining from Barcelona was both exciting and challenging. Packing and shipping all belongings and memories of 7 happy years over 1.800 kilometers is not an easy task. Needless to say, finding a flat in Berlin and dealing with the German bureaucracy on top of moving arrangements was particularly hard.</description>

      <description>My latest geocaches This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
 Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.
 The history of Geocaching goes back to the year 2000 and the invention of GPS itself, with The Great American GPS Stash Hunt as a way to test the accuracy of the devices hunting a hidden bucket in Beavercreek, Oregon, near Portland.</description>

      <description>A book about Beers (or how I am less ignorant) This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
I bought The complete beer course a couple of months ago. It has traveled from my office and my flat in Berlin to my family house in Barcelona, however only until this week (few days before new year&amp;rsquo;s eve), I have finally found the time to began reading through its pages as part of my self-imposed challenge&amp;hellip; procrastination at its best.</description>

      <description>Monitoring my plant using sensors, relayr&amp;rsquo;s cloud, resin.io and the Raspberry Pi This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This post is a continuation of the Raspberry Pi powered plant monitoring system post, in which I discussed the project requirements, and briefly showed how to flash the resinOS to a Raspberry Pi and waterproof a soil sensor.
Nothing too fancy by then.
Now I will show:</description>

      <description>A Karaoke night This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
Me, my wife and close friends went to the Almodobar&amp;rsquo;s karaoke bar in Barcelona - best night ever. We arrived at 23:30, which was great as the place was empty and we got the microphones to ourselves for almost an hour, enough to warm up and drink up (with the mandatory tequila/whiskey starter shot).</description>

      <description>Understanding Amazon This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This is a short post - I had in my list for a long time to start using Amazon, however it is a big bone to chew at once, so I decided first to take a small stab and first understand what Amazon is all about.
Udemy Academy has a free video course on AWS concepts, which made easy to follow through in my mobile phone while commuting to work what Amazon is all about: VPCs, EC2, S3 and RDS (lot of acronyms).</description>

      <description>My Daughter&amp;rsquo;s book This is part of my Challenge to make 26 years before 2017 ends.
I had an overdue and on-going task in my list: write a book for Erin, my daughter. I began writing a fantastic tale about Erin (our fearless heroin) and her surprising companion back in June 5th 2017, and now, November 25th it is finally done and sent to the printers.
Literally.

In Spanish.</description>

      <description>A resin.io example service This is part of my Challenge to make 26 years before 2017 ends.
This is part of my Project to build an autonomous and remote-controlled watering system for my bonsai, and part of my learning journey to use resin.io. The first step was to understand how to deploy to resin.io and my target device.
Setting up the repository and first tests The project repository lives at: https://github.</description>

      <description>Erin&amp;rsquo;s children&amp;rsquo;s book This project is quite personal, as it is my first children&amp;rsquo;s story ever to be published solely for my daughter, Erin. It has a lot of inside jokes and references.
It was meant to be her birthday&amp;rsquo;s gift (last May), however due to work and other demons, it had to be postponed and now it will be her Christmas present - I hope I don&amp;rsquo;t screw up this time.</description>

      <description>The 2017 challenge I was a bit bored and feeling depressed by end of September 2017 - living in Berlin eight months away from my family took most of my motivation and sanity, and I was getting my &amp;ldquo;kicks&amp;rdquo; only from my job, which is OK, but going also from developer to full manager has its downsides&amp;hellip;
At the Deadline Demo Party, while coding and watching some Intros, I made up my mind, and decided to challenge myself, and try to do 26 things before 2017 ended.</description>

      <description>Making an Ajiaco This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
The Ajiaco: one of the most traditional dishes of Colombia&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.

This dish is heavily served in Bogot√° (the capital of Colombia), a thick hot soup (perfect for its cold days), made out of three types of potatoes, chicken, corn and the Galinsoga parviflora herb (called Guasca in Colombia).
There are tons of recipes on-line, but this type of dish has a strong root in families, thus I&amp;rsquo;m adapting the traditional recipe of my Auntie Cristina (hoping she won&amp;rsquo;t be highly disappointed at me afterwards).</description>

      <description>IoT automated plant watering and monitoring system This project idea came out while thinking about stuff to build before year 2017 ends. The motivation is simple: avoid plants dying in my watch, likely also saving some lives in my wife&amp;rsquo;s garden as well if everything goes OK.
Whilst installing sensors is easy, I want to experiment with other technologies and paradigms as well, thus this project is a sandbox to learn and test new concepts and applications, having a concrete use case in mind.</description>

      <description>Monitoring my new plant using sensors and the Raspberry Pi This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This type of project is nothing new in the Makersphere, using environmental sensors with the Raspberry Pi (and Arduinos, ESP8266, etc.) has been done since it&amp;rsquo;s early beginnings, and it is perhaps one of the most implemented use cases.
Then what is new?
Likely nothing surprisingly, however, I would attempt to take this above the normal &amp;ldquo;demo and forget&amp;rdquo; existing setups, and create something with a product-oriented approach.</description>

      <description>This blog Creating an improving this blog is itself a project. Although I prefer to keep day to day progress in separate blog posts, I thought it would be good to keep track of the projects&amp;rsquo; evolution in a single placeholder - tags are also helpful and included, but this way I can have a better index for my own later reference.
Some specific about the blog, like minimum improvements like adding tags, categories, or internal links, are not necessarily tracked in a post, as I already made publicly available the blog&amp;rsquo;s sources - peep as you need!</description>

      <description>My new bonsai This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
Finally, after some consideration and procrastination, I decided to get a plant (and care for living beings). Fortunately, my current company has a great policy about office plants for employees.
Enter &amp;ldquo;Ligu&amp;rdquo; 
I got the bonsai from Exotenherz, an on-line shop specialized in plants, with an awesome shipping time and great care to transport plants.</description>

      <description>On how I attempt to create my own Company in Germany as an exPat This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
Work in progress.
Why opening a company in Germany? well, because I can.
I have lived with Impostor syndrome all my life, which prevents me some times from taking huge initiatives based on my own, however, lately my inner circle and professional peers are encouraging me to go forward.</description>

      <description>Deploy a Hugo website to Github pages and build with Travis CI  GitHub provides free and fast static hosting over SSL for personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository via its GitHub Pages service.
 I know there are other options, such as Netlify, but I was not too keen to yet depend on another framework, specially one using node.js&amp;hellip; famous last words&amp;hellip;
