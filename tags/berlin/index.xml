      <description>Our trip to Berlin This is part of my previous Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying to finish now in 2018.
After living and working abroad (in Berlin, Germany) for almost a year, having my family (finally) joining from Barcelona was both exciting and challenging. Packing and shipping all belongings and memories of 7 happy years over 1.800 kilometers is not an easy task. Needless to say, finding a flat in Berlin and dealing with the German bureaucracy on top of moving arrangements was particularly hard.</description>

      <description>My latest geocaches This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
 Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.
 The history of Geocaching goes back to the year 2000 and the invention of GPS itself, with The Great American GPS Stash Hunt as a way to test the accuracy of the devices hunting a hidden bucket in Beavercreek, Oregon, near Portland.</description>
