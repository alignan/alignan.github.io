      <description>Making an Ajiaco This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
The Ajiaco: one of the most traditional dishes of Colombia&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.

This dish is heavily served in Bogot√° (the capital of Colombia), a thick hot soup (perfect for its cold days), made out of three types of potatoes, chicken, corn and the Galinsoga parviflora herb (called Guasca in Colombia).
There are tons of recipes on-line, but this type of dish has a strong root in families, thus I&amp;rsquo;m adapting the traditional recipe of my Auntie Cristina (hoping she won&amp;rsquo;t be highly disappointed at me afterwards).</description>
