      <description>Moving from Wunderground to OpenWeatherMap From Wunderground site:
 The Weather Underground API has reached the end of service. To purchase access to the replacement API, please see our Weather Data Packages. If you are a contracted, paying customer and feel you have been shut off in error, please email feedback.wunderground@weather.com; be sure to include your name and API key.
 My wunderground-powered weather dashboard) was sadly a victim of this change, and as for my personal use I don&amp;rsquo;t need the extended (paid) services or features offered in The Weather Company tiers, I had to look for a different option to enable back my dashboard.</description>

      <description>My latest geocaches (2018) This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2018 ends.
 Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.
 In 2017 I resumed geocaching, so I wanted to keep going out and hunting for treasures. Through 2018 I have been more active, and my family has embraced once again this activity thus now collecting as a team.</description>

      <description>Compile VLC with Hardware Acceleration for the Raspberry Pi (Stretch) Credits to Raspberry Pi Forum.
The VLC version from Raspbian doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the GPU of the RPi, and isn&amp;rsquo;t able to play high resolution videos. An alternative is to compile to include this, but be careful as depending on the Raspbian distribution (Stretch, Wheezy, etc.) the dependencies and patches may be different. This notebook targets Stretch, and it has been well-tested in a Raspberry Pi version 3.</description>

From the Blog:
 One the latest version of SSH installed on the Raspberry Pi 3 uses QoS headers to ensure speedy delivery of packets over the network. For interactive connections (standard shell SSH connections) it sets the IP header for IP_TOS to be 0x10 (low delay or latency).</description>

      <description>Our trip to Berlin This is part of my previous Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying to finish now in 2018.
After living and working abroad (in Berlin, Germany) for almost a year, having my family (finally) joining from Barcelona was both exciting and challenging. Packing and shipping all belongings and memories of 7 happy years over 1.800 kilometers is not an easy task. Needless to say, finding a flat in Berlin and dealing with the German bureaucracy on top of moving arrangements was particularly hard.</description>

 Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.
 The history of Geocaching goes back to the year 2000 and the invention of GPS itself, with The Great American GPS Stash Hunt as a way to test the accuracy of the devices hunting a hidden bucket in Beavercreek, Oregon, near Portland.</description>

I bought The complete beer course a couple of months ago. It has traveled from my office and my flat in Berlin to my family house in Barcelona, however only until this week (few days before new year&amp;rsquo;s eve), I have finally found the time to began reading through its pages as part of my self-imposed challenge&amp;hellip; procrastination at its best.</description>

Me, my wife and close friends went to the Almodobar&amp;rsquo;s karaoke bar in Barcelona - best night ever.

      <description>Understanding Amazon This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This is a short post - I had in my list for a long time to start using Amazon, however it is a big bone to chew at once, so I decided first to take a small stab and first understand what Amazon is all about.
Udemy Academy has a free video course on AWS concepts, which made easy to follow through in my mobile phone while commuting to work what Amazon is all about: VPCs, EC2, S3 and RDS (lot of acronyms).</description>

Literally.

      <description>A review from an Intern 
I take great proud of teaching and developing my team members - both professionally and personally - it is the most rewarding experience and joy of being a technical manager.
Team development is not not only related to the Junior members of the team, but Seniors as well: there are several dimensions which contributes to career development, being the most proficient coder is not enough, if you can&amp;rsquo;t lead others by example or fail to clearly communicate ideas to peers and managers.</description>

      <description>Whatsapp removes Exif properties When backing up the photos from my mobile phone to my laptop, and then to Google Photos I noticed something odd: when syncing, most of the photos were shown as it were created just at that moment, even if some images were months older.
This is quite inconvenient.
Then I noticed not all the photos backed to Google Photos had this problem, and a deeper look at the EXIF properties of two different files confirmed my assumptions: Whatsapp removes these properties when sharing photos.</description>

      <description>Making an Ajiaco This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
The Ajiaco: one of the most traditional dishes of Colombia&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.

This dish is heavily served in Bogotá (the capital of Colombia), a thick hot soup (perfect for its cold days), made out of three types of potatoes, chicken, corn and the Galinsoga parviflora herb (called Guasca in Colombia).
There are tons of recipes on-line, but this type of dish has a strong root in families, thus I&amp;rsquo;m adapting the traditional recipe of my Auntie Cristina (hoping she won&amp;rsquo;t be highly disappointed at me afterwards).</description>

      <description>Understanding Resin and ResinOS I felt I needed to write this post about Resin.io, as I was jumping directly into deploying and building in a Raspberry Pi (see this post), just jumping from one tutorial to the next.
It is good to pace down, understand, and then go full speed.
Resin.io  Resin.io makes it simple to deploy, update, and maintain code running on remote devices. We are bringing the web development and deployment workflow to hardware, using tools like git and Docker to allow you to seamlessly update all your embedded linux devices in the wild.</description>

 Remove the MicroSD card, under the /boot partition locate and edit the /boot/config.json file. Change the hostname accordingly:  { &amp;quot;persistentLogging&amp;quot;: false, &amp;quot;hostname&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;resin&amp;quot;, }   Configure the local network. I think this can also be done remotely, however is handy to know where to look:  [connection] id=resin-sample type=wifi [wifi] mode=infrastructure ssid=I_Love_Unicorns [wifi-security] auth-alg=open key-mgmt=wpa-psk psk=superSecretPassword [ipv4] method=auto [ipv6] addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy method=auto   Pinging the device (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t changed the hostname):  $ ping resin.</description>

This type of project is nothing new in the Makersphere, using environmental sensors with the Raspberry Pi (and Arduinos, ESP8266, etc.) has been done since it&amp;rsquo;s early beginnings, and it is perhaps one of the most implemented use cases.
Then what is new?
Likely nothing surprisingly, however, I would attempt to take this above the normal &amp;ldquo;demo and forget&amp;rdquo; existing setups, and create something with a product-oriented approach.</description>
