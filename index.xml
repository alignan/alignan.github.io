 The Weather Underground API has reached the end of service. To purchase access to the replacement API, please see our Weather Data Packages. If you are a contracted, paying customer and feel you have been shut off in error, please email feedback.wunderground@weather.com; be sure to include your name and API key.
 My wunderground-powered weather dashboard) was sadly a victim of this change, and as for my personal use I don&amp;rsquo;t need the extended (paid) services or features offered in The Weather Company tiers, I had to look for a different option to enable back my dashboard.</description>

      <description>My latest geocaches (2018) This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2018 ends.
 Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.
 In 2017 I resumed geocaching, so I wanted to keep going out and hunting for treasures. Through 2018 I have been more active, and my family has embraced once again this activity thus now collecting as a team.</description>

      <description>Compile VLC with Hardware Acceleration for the Raspberry Pi (Stretch) Credits to Raspberry Pi Forum.
The VLC version from Raspbian doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the GPU of the RPi, and isn&amp;rsquo;t able to play high resolution videos. An alternative is to compile to include this, but be careful as depending on the Raspbian distribution (Stretch, Wheezy, etc.) the dependencies and patches may be different. This notebook targets Stretch, and it has been well-tested in a Raspberry Pi version 3.</description>

      <description>Our trip to Berlin This is part of my previous Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying to finish now in 2018.
After living and working abroad (in Berlin, Germany) for almost a year, having my family (finally) joining from Barcelona was both exciting and challenging. Packing and shipping all belongings and memories of 7 happy years over 1.800 kilometers is not an easy task. Needless to say, finding a flat in Berlin and dealing with the German bureaucracy on top of moving arrangements was particularly hard.</description>

 The history of Geocaching goes back to the year 2000 and the invention of GPS itself, with The Great American GPS Stash Hunt as a way to test the accuracy of the devices hunting a hidden bucket in Beavercreek, Oregon, near Portland.</description>

This is a short post - I had in my list for a long time to start using Amazon, however it is a big bone to chew at once, so I decided first to take a small stab and first understand what Amazon is all about.
Udemy Academy has a free video course on AWS concepts, which made easy to follow through in my mobile phone while commuting to work what Amazon is all about: VPCs, EC2, S3 and RDS (lot of acronyms).</description>

 This booklet is a quick but thoughtful guide to jump into the Internet of Things, covering important subjects as IPv6 networking, sensors, wireless protocols and technologies, as well as IoT cloud platforms and its most commonly used protocols, featuring lots of hands-on examples to start working from day one.
The lessons and examples are heavily focused on Contiki OS, a well known IoT operating system well suited for low power embedded devices, and the Zolertia Z1 mote, a widely used hardware platform to develop a wide range of IoT applications.</description>

I take great proud of teaching and developing my team members - both professionally and personally - it is the most rewarding experience and joy of being a technical manager.
Team development is not not only related to the Junior members of the team, but Seniors as well: there are several dimensions which contributes to career development, being the most proficient coder is not enough, if you can&amp;rsquo;t lead others by example or fail to clearly communicate ideas to peers and managers.</description>

      <description>Whatsapp removes Exif properties When backing up the photos from my mobile phone to my laptop, and then to Google Photos I noticed something odd: when syncing, most of the photos were shown as it were created just at that moment, even if some images were months older.
This is quite inconvenient.
Then I noticed not all the photos backed to Google Photos had this problem, and a deeper look at the EXIF properties of two different files confirmed my assumptions: Whatsapp removes these properties when sharing photos.</description>

The Ajiaco: one of the most traditional dishes of Colombia&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.

This dish is heavily served in Bogotá (the capital of Colombia), a thick hot soup (perfect for its cold days), made out of three types of potatoes, chicken, corn and the Galinsoga parviflora herb (called Guasca in Colombia).
There are tons of recipes on-line, but this type of dish has a strong root in families, thus I&amp;rsquo;m adapting the traditional recipe of my Auntie Cristina (hoping she won&amp;rsquo;t be highly disappointed at me afterwards).</description>

I think this can also be done remotely, however is handy to know where to look:  [connection] id=resin-sample type=wifi [wifi] mode=infrastructure ssid=I_Love_Unicorns [wifi-security] auth-alg=open key-mgmt=wpa-psk psk=superSecretPassword [ipv4] method=auto [ipv6] addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy method=auto   Pinging the device (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t changed the hostname):  $ ping resin.</description>

      <description>IoT automated plant watering and monitoring system This project idea came out while thinking about stuff to build before year 2017 ends. The motivation is simple: avoid plants dying in my watch, likely also saving some lives in my wife&amp;rsquo;s garden as well if everything goes OK.
Whilst installing sensors is easy, I want to experiment with other technologies and paradigms as well, thus this project is a sandbox to learn and test new concepts and applications, having a concrete use case in mind.</description>

      <description>Monitoring my new plant using sensors and the Raspberry Pi This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
This type of project is nothing new in the Makersphere, using environmental sensors with the Raspberry Pi (and Arduinos, ESP8266, etc.) has been done since it&amp;rsquo;s early beginnings, and it is perhaps one of the most implemented use cases.
Then what is new?
Likely nothing surprisingly, however, I would attempt to take this above the normal &amp;ldquo;demo and forget&amp;rdquo; existing setups, and create something with a product-oriented approach.</description>

      <description>This blog Creating an improving this blog is itself a project. Although I prefer to keep day to day progress in separate blog posts, I thought it would be good to keep track of the projects&amp;rsquo; evolution in a single placeholder - tags are also helpful and included, but this way I can have a better index for my own later reference.
Some specific about the blog, like minimum improvements like adding tags, categories, or internal links, are not necessarily tracked in a post, as I already made publicly available the blog&amp;rsquo;s sources - peep as you need!</description>

      <description>My new bonsai This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
Finally, after some consideration and procrastination, I decided to get a plant (and care for living beings). Fortunately, my current company has a great policy about office plants for employees.
Enter &amp;ldquo;Ligu&amp;rdquo; 
I got the bonsai from Exotenherz, an on-line shop specialized in plants, with an awesome shipping time and great care to transport plants.</description>

      <description>On how I attempt to create my own Company in Germany as an exPat This is part of my Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends.
Work in progress.
Why opening a company in Germany? well, because I can.
I have lived with Impostor syndrome all my life, which prevents me some times from taking huge initiatives based on my own, however, lately my inner circle and professional peers are encouraging me to go forward.</description>

      <description>Deploy a Hugo website to Github pages and build with Travis CI  GitHub provides free and fast static hosting over SSL for personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository via its GitHub Pages service.
 I know there are other options, such as Netlify, but I was not too keen to yet depend on another framework, specially one using node.js&amp;hellip; famous last words&amp;hellip;
This is part of my Challenge to make 26 years before 2017 ends.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m Antonio Liñán Colina, father of two, husband and tinkerer.
I have a Dalmatian, my wife has a cat that hates me.
Born in Cartagena, Colombia - now traveling to &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; cities, as I have lived in Bogotá (Colombia), Bilbao (Vizcaya), Barcelona (Catalonia) and now in Berlin (Germany).
